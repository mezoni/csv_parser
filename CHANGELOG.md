## 0.1.22

- The parser has become a little faster after rebuilding with new version of `parser_builder`
- Configurable parser has become faster after adding new features to `parser_builder` to create efficient configurable parsers. Now the `fast_csv_ex` parser has become about 15% faster. Now it about 15% slower than the non-configurable parser (before that the difference was 30%). Not much, but it's always beneficial
